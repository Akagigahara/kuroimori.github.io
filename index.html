            Hello and welcome to my website! <br />
            I am an independant freelance programmer that is working through Fiverr to earn some additional money, as well as gain some more practice when it comes to coding. <br />
            Currently, I work in no specific field, as I mainly fulfill customer specific requests, such as programming an independant program or help with school-related issues. <br>
            My main languages are C# as well as Java, in both of which I know the basics relatively well.
